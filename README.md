# Label Shift

Python library for *quantification* (estimating the class prevalence in an unlabeled data set) under the prior probability shift assumption.

This module is created with two purposes in mind:
  - easily apply state-of-the-art quantification algorithms to the real problems,
  - benchmark novel quantification algorithms against others.

It is compatible with any classifier using any machine learning framework.

The code inside was used to run the experiments in [our preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09159), which can be cited as:

## Installation
Currently the module is in early development stage and is not ready to be installed. It does not have proper documentation either. We hope to change it soon – thank you for your patience!
